# Ersatz Socket

> A prototype of a server-socket testing library similar to the Ersatz Server library.

***NOTE:*** If there is any interest in using this project, please let me know - it's at a point where it could be polished and published, but my original reason for writing it has disappeared so unless someone gives me a nudge it will probably sit for a while.
